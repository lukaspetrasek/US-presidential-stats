This is a repository containing the code developed during the work on a school project whose goal is to achieve the following:

* scrape web pages to get historical data on US presidents
* manipulate the data into a form suitable for being visualized
* make vizualizations based the data

All functionality is demonstrated in the [US presidential statistics notebook](/US-presidential-stats.ipynb)
